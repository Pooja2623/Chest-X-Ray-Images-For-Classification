# Chest-X-Ray-Images-For-Classification
This project uses a CNN-based deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images, detecting whether a patient has pneumonia or is normal. The model processes labeled X-ray images to accurately identify pneumonia cases, aiming to assist healthcare professionals with timely and precise diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
