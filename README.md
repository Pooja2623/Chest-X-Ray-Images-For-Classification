Project : Chest X-Ray Image Classification for Pneumonia Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images, determining whether a patient has pneumonia or a normal (healthy) condition. Pneumonia is a severe lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early detection through reliable and accurate diagnostic tools is crucial for effective treatment and management. Leveraging the power of deep learning and medical imaging, this project seeks to provide an automated solution to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia.

Objectives
Develop a CNN model: Design and train a convolutional neural network to accurately classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or normal.
Enhance diagnostic accuracy: Improve the precision and recall of pneumonia detection compared to traditional methods and non-deep learning approaches.
Deploy a scalable solution: Ensure the model can be integrated into healthcare systems for real-time diagnosis and support in clinical settings.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled chest X-ray images, which are divided into two categories:

Pneumonia: X-ray images of patients diagnosed with pneumonia.
Normal: X-ray images of healthy patients without pneumonia.
Conclusion
This project harnesses the power of deep learning and medical imaging to develop a robust tool for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. By automating the diagnostic process, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals, reduce diagnostic errors, and enhance patient care through timely and accurate detection of pneumonia.
